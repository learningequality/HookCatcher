        Desired output ->
        1. Relevant git Commits and PR information is added to our tables
        2. images are taken for all new states BUT NOT FOR PREXISTING STATES THAT HAVE IMAGES
        3. Diffs are generated for all pairs of images that can be diffed

        ~ If no states are even checked in, do nothing.
        ~ if PR number isn''t valid, do nothing
